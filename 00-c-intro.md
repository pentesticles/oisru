# Introduction

A Risk Universe provides a comprehensive view of the possible risks we face. This view is designed to aid in categorisation but also to act as a check on the scope of our risk identification exercises to ensure we donâ€™t miss risks that then take us by surprise when they occur.

The goal of the Open Information Security Risk Universe (OISRU) is to provide a model and method independent framework for expressing and categorising security risk.

This framework should be complementary to the Basel II operational risk event types, recognising that information security risk permeates operational risk.

## Overview of the Risk Universe

The Open Information Security Risk Universe comprises, at it's core, Sources of Risk Events, Risk Events and Consequences of Risk Events. These are supplemented by Risk Factors that drive the Frequency or Severity of the Risks.
